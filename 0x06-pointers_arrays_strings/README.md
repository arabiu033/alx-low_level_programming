# 0x06 C - More pointers, arrays and strings :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This project covers third part of pointers, arrays and strings concepts

  At the end of this project, I am able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that concatenates two strings.
1. Function that concatenates two strings v2.
2. Function that copies a string.
3. Function that compares two strings.
4. Function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
5. Function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
6. Function that capitalizes all words of a string.
7. Function that encodes a string into 1337.
8. Function that encodes a string using rot13.
9. Function that prints an integer.
10. Add one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98
11. Function that adds two numbers.
12. Function that prints a buffer. (in progress)
